## Datasets info
### Datasets Sourcess
The Chengdu dataset is derived from Didi vehicle trajectory data in Chengdu collected in November 2016, as detailed in [1](https://github.com/chenyuqi990215/RNTrajRec/tree/master/preprocess). The Harbin dataset includes data from over 13,000 taxis, recording more than 1 million trips over 5 days, which can be obtained from [2].
